# MediChat Development Challenge: Building a Healthcare Chatbot

## Overview
This challenge involves developing a healthcare-focused chatbot that utilises Large Language
Models (LLMs) to interact intelligently with users. Additionally, you are tasked with creating a web
interface using Streamlit and deploying a real-time dashboard that visualises conversation metrics
and trends.

## Expectations and Deliverables

* Healthcare Chatbot: A fully functional chatbot capable of handling healthcare-related
queries with an understanding of medical terminology.
* Web Interface: A user-friendly web interface built with Streamlit that allows users to
interact with the chatbot.
* Real-time Dashboard: A dashboard that displays real-time statistics and charts showing
the constituents of conversations, such as the number of queries handled, common topics,
user feedback scores, etc.

## Technologies to be Used
* Large Language Model (LLM): Use OpenAI's GPT-3, accessed via the OpenAI API, tailored
for medical interactions.
* Programming Language: Python, leveraging its strong support for AI, web development,
and data visualisation.
* Web Framework: Streamlit for building the web interface and deploying the application.
* Data Visualization: Libraries such as Plotly or Matplotlib integrated into Streamlit for
real-time data visualisation.
* Development Environment: Standard Python development environment, ensuring
compatibility with Streamlit.
* Version Control: Git and GitHub for version control and project hosting.
